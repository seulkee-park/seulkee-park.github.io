    title: About 
    summary: "I am a syntactician with research interests at the syntax-semantics interface. I am also interested in corpus linguistics and syntax-phonetics interface.
    <br /> <br />
    
In 2022, I received a PhD in linguistics from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. My dissertation centers on the syntax and semantics of non-standard <i>wh</i>-constructions in Korean (e.g., <i>why</i>-like <i>what</i>-interrogatives, <i>what</i>-exclamatives).
<br /><br />

Currently, I am working as a lecturer at Kyung Hee University and Chung-Ang University."
