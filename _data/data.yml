career-profile:
    title: Seulkee Park
    summary: I am a lecturer in the Department of English Linguistics and Literature at both Kyung Hee University and Chung-Ang University in Seoul. My primary research areas focus on discourse syntax and corpus linguistics in English. My ongoing research lies within the domains of diverse elliptical constructions in English, including but not limited to stripping, nominal ellipsis, and fragmental structures like sluicing, based on a discourse information analysis.
